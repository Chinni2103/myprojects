   <p id="p1"><h2>PARA-1</h2> Dreams" Summary<br>
"Dreams" by Langston Hughes is very short: <br>just two quatrains (a stanza of four lines) for a total of eight lines.<br> In both quatrains, Hughes repeats his main message: "Hold fast to dreams."<br> By "dreams," Hughes means bigger goals, aspirations, and hopes for a person's life rather than dreams at night.<br> After the repeated line, each quatrain includes an image to show what life is like without dreams. <br>In the first, life without dreams is a "broken-winged bird that cannot fly." In the second, life without dreams is "a barren field frozen with snow." <br>The poem's simplicity, brevity, and straightforwardness underscore the message and make it all the more clear.<br>

Literary Devices in "Dreams"<br>
In his poem "Dreams," Langston Hughes uses several poetic devices.<br> Langston Hughes' poems, including Dreams, frequently use specific styles to mimic everyday speech; <br>he uses common imagery and metaphor that are easy to understand, and repetition drives the point home. <br>Read on for some analysis of these devices in "Dreams" by Langston Hughes.
<br>
Style and format<br>
The style and format of "Dreams" reach a broad audience.<br> Because it's so short, it's easy to remember; as a result, the message comes to the forefront and practically anyone who can read can understand it.<br> The poem's brevity also implies a sense of urgency. Holding on to dreams is so important that there's no time for more developed or elaborate imagery, or even more than eight lines.
</p>
<p id="p3"><h2>PARA-3</h2>
"Dreams" also follows a simple rhyme scheme: ABCB DEFE. <br>The second and fourth lines of each quatrain rhyme. This has a couple of effects:
<br>
Rhyme makes the lines, and thus the poem, easier to remember<br>
Rhyme pushes the language of the poem in a more melodic, jazzy direction appropriate for the culture and "sound" of the Harlem Renaissance time period
<br>These two elements - rhyme and brevity - make the poem an urgent, focused exhortation to hold fast to dreams.

Imagery<br>
A snowy, barren field, like life without dreams

A snowy barren field
Even in such a short poem as "Dreams," Langston Hughes creates some striking imagery. The two major images at play in "Dreams" are:

    </h3>
<p id="p5"><h2>PARA-5</h2>
A broken-winged bird that cannot fly
A barren field frozen with snow
These images aren't complicated; they're powerful in their simplicity. Since they're so easy to understand, the broken-winged bird and the barren field make the message of the poem more urgent when they're deployed as metaphors.
</p>
<p id="p6"><h2>PARA-6</h2>
Metaphors
When dreams die, life is a broken-winged bird that cannot fly.

a black and white bird on the ground
A metaphor is a comparison between two things without using "like" or "as." (A comparison that uses "like" or "as" is a simile). In "Dreams," Langston Hughes develops his central metaphor in two ways. He compares life without dreams to a broken-winged bird that cannot fly and to a barren field frozen with snow. Since the images are so plain and concrete, the metaphor is clear: life without dreams is no good. This makes the message of the whole poem clear as day: hold on to your dreams, because without them, life is meaningless.
</p>
<p id="p7"><h2>PARA-7</h2>
Repetition<br>
Hughes repeats the line "Hold fast to dreams" at the beginning of each quatrain of "Dreams." Repetition in poetry can be used for a few different purposes:
<br>
To draw specific attention to an idea<br>
To cast an idea in a new light<br>
To give a counterexample or new context to an idea<br>
In "Dreams," Hughes repeats "Hold fast to dreams" to draw greater attention to the idea, as it's the main message of the poem. It's what he wants the reader to take away after they've read the poem, a thesis statement of sorts. Then the imagery, metaphor, and other poetic devices are the evidence to support his repeated "argument."
<br>
"Dreams" Theme<br>
Putting it all together now, a clear picture of the "Dreams" by Langston Hughes' theme emerges. The repeated line "Hold fast to dreams" is the what, and the imagery and metaphor are the why. The reader should hold fast to their dreams, because without dreams life is motionless, barren, and meaningless.
